# AzerApi python spamtool
 This python program contains a spambot to annoy people(scammers,, your friends and the lot)
 ands features a automated spam message function for chatsites that use the esc key to skip your chat partner.
 As i've updated the script i've come to the conclusion that it needed a bit of security, so i made it that you can only spam an unlimited amount of times if you use a password.
 also i've added a discord spam feature wich can only spam as much as the discord rate limit allows.
 I've also removed the exe part beacause it made it a heck of a lot more difficult to update.
 
 
 ## how to run
 To run this python script you need to open up a terminal or cmd of your choosing(for windows i reccomend cmder or windows terminal) then typ the following command:
 python path/to/file/azerapispamtools.py
 
 and it will load up in the cmd window.
 
 # Important:
 before using AzerApi spamtools make sure to set a password in the config file, otherwise you won't be able to use the script to its full capabilty
 
 
 
 Cheers!,
